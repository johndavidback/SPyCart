Okay, this is meant to be a functioning cart in Python / Django.

Meaning, it's not just some class you download and have to figure out.

With the installation instructions you should be able to download the
source, set up your site (provided you have Django installed), sync
your db, and get rockin and rollin.  How does that sound?

Okay, it's a little ambitious for a weekend project, but it's a good
first git thing, so it's whatever.
